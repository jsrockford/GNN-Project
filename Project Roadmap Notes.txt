Yes, I'm familiar with Open WebUI! It's a popular web interface for Ollama that provides features like conversation history, model management, and parameter settings. 

For our project roadmap, we could:

1. First Phase - Core Functionality Enhancement:
- Improve memory retrieval accuracy
- Add conversation tagging/categorization
- Add memory search capabilities
- Implement conversation export/import

2. Second Phase - Web Interface Integration:
- Create a Flask/FastAPI backend for our memory system
- Design a React-based frontend similar to Open WebUI
- Add visualization of memory connections (graph view)
- Implement real-time embedding visualization

3. Third Phase - Advanced Features:
- Add conversation threading
- Implement memory pruning/management
- Add multi-model conversation capability
- Create memory sharing between models

Would you like to:
1. Focus on any particular phase first?
2. See a more detailed breakdown of any component?
3. Discuss integration possibilities with Open WebUI itself?


For someone new to software project development, let's start with some structured first steps:

1. Project Setup and Documentation:
- Create a proper GitHub repository
- Set up a basic project structure
- Write initial documentation including:
  - Project description
  - Setup instructions
  - Current features
  - Planned features (roadmap)

2. Current Code Organization:
- Move our existing code into proper modules
- Set up proper dependency management (requirements.txt)
- Add comments and docstrings
- Create basic tests structure

3. Choose First Feature to Implement:
- Start small with something from Phase 1
- Perhaps the conversation tagging since it builds on our existing memory system
- Or the memory search capabilities which would be immediately useful

Would you like me to help you with any of these initial steps? I could:
1. Help set up the GitHub repository structure
2. Show how to organize our current code better
3. Create the initial documentation

Starting with good organization and documentation will make the later development phases much smoother!
